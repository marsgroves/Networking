Computer Networking lessons.

Open system:
A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 

Closed system: 
A system which is not connected to the network and can’t be communicated with. 

Computer Network: 
An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges. 

Network Topology:
The layout arrangement of the different devices in a network. Common examples include: Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, and Daisy chain. 
 
What are the network layers?
While TCP/IP is the newer model, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is still referenced a lot to describe network layers. The OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization. There are 7 layers:

1. Physical (e.g. cable, RJ45)
2. Data Link (e.g. MAC, switches)
3. Network (e.g. IP, routers)
4. Transport (e.g. TCP, UDP, port numbers)
5. Session (e.g. SYN/ACK)
6. Presentation (e.g. encryption, ASCII, PNG, MIDI)
7. Application (e.g. SNMP, HTTP, FTP)

People have come up with tons of mnemonic devices to memorize the OSI network layers. One popular mnemonic, starting with Layer 7, is “All People Seem To Need Data Processing.” But one that I’m partial to, which starts with Layer 1, is “Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away.”

The TCP/IP model is a more concise framework, with only 4 layers:

1. Network Access (or Link)
