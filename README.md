Computer Networking lessons.

Open system:
A system which is connected to the network and is ready for communication. 

Closed system: 
A system which is not connected to the network and canâ€™t be communicated with. 

Computer Network: 
An interconnection of multiple devices, also known as hosts, that are connected using multiple paths for the purpose of sending/receiving data or media. Computer networks can also include multiple devices/mediums which help in the communication between two different devices; these are known as Network devices and include things such as routers, switches, hubs, and bridges. 

Network Topology:
The layout arrangement of the different devices in a network. Common examples include: Bus, Star, Mesh, Ring, and Daisy chain. 
 
What are the network layers?
While TCP/IP is the newer model, the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model is still referenced a lot to describe network layers. The OSI model was developed by the International Organization for Standardization. There are 7 layers:

1. Physical (e.g. cable, RJ45)
2. Data Link (e.g. MAC, switches)
3. Network (e.g. IP, routers)
4. Transport (e.g. TCP, UDP, port numbers)
5. Session (e.g. SYN/ACK)
